# AI_Pathfinder
AI Pathfinder is a Python GUI application that visualizes how six uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDDFS, Bidirectional) navigate a grid with dynamic obstacles. It allows users to interactively explore paths, compare algorithm performance, and observe real-time statistics such as nodes explored, path length, and time taken.
